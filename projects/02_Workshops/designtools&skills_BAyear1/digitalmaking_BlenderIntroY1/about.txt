	Introduction
The Digital Making workshop focuses on the process of translating complex ideas into visually compelling narratives through the creation of a concise 1-minute video project. Over the course of three weeks, students will engage in multimedia storytelling.  
We will work through every stage of the production process, including storyboarding, compositional planning, 3D modeling, rendering, and post-production. The curriculum encourages a balance between technical proficiency and creative exploration, guiding students to articulate complex concepts effectively through visual media.
Conceptualization and Storyboarding
Program: Worldbuilding fundamentals, and development, setting the groups, the theme, and preparing the template After Effects file, following a group feedback session.

	1. Pedagogical Activities
In Workshop 10 of DTS1, you will learn about modelling, cutting, sectioning, and manipulating 3D models procedurally. The goal is to gain fluency in data-driven design and procedural workflows. 
2. Objectives
You will continue learning Houdini basics, and geometry management to have an understanding of how computational design can enhance architectural representation, design exploration and fabrication.

   4. Homework



Task A.1: SLICER


Import models (.obj, .fbx, .glb, etc.). Using a for each loop, create a procedural clipping setup.


In class  Deliver a screenshot of your procedure on Discord between 17:30 and 18:00 (please note that screenshots taken during the early stages of setup will incur a point deduction).


On Tuesday, 15th, select and submit one of the iterations (still image/series of drawings in .png, .jpeg, .gif, or .mp4 format).

Task A.2: WAFFLE 


Utilizing boolean operations and loops, create a waffle structure setup. 
Tuesday 15th select and submit one of the iterations with a turntable animation in .mp4 format.


File Naming:
DTS Code_WK10_01_A2.mp4
  



Task B.1: SECTION


Start thinking about the scale and bring elements that can indicate the scale to your drawings. Improve the visualization by using colors and defining a hierarchy between certain things in the section drawing. 


Tuesday 15th pick and deliver one of the iterations, that contains an indicator of the scale (still image/series of drawings(.png .jpeg .gif)/(.mp4)
